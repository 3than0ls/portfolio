# Personal Website and Portfolio

My personal website that I designed and coded from scratch during college. I intend to work on this continuously, improving it and adding to it as I gain experience with new projects and internships.

You're probably viewing this text on the very website itself! If not, visit it here at [INSERT LINK](LINK)!

## Fun Fact

The website's accent color is a bright neon orange, and even the primary and secondary colors (regardless of dark or light mode) are tinged with orange. It's my favorite color!
