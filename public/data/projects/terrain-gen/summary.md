## Algorithm Inputs and Effects

**Smoothness**, ranging from 0 to 1, determines the smoothness of the output. The lower the smoothness, the more staticky the values may appear. Higher smoothness reduces this.

**Amplitude**, a positive integer, also helps determines the difference in values, essentially influencing the difference between the lowest and highest point.
However, if normalizing, amplitude is essentially irrelevant.

See comparisons of inputs below.
