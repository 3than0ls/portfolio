# Genotypic

This is one of my earliest projects, done when I was 16. I had just started picking up React, with a mild familiarity with Javascript. Needless to say, I've come a long way.

I'm proud of this one because not only was it my foray into web applications and web development, but I also used it to generate Punnett squares, while over-engineered and unecessary, helped me with my AP Biology homework.
